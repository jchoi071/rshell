Written with vim in C++ on UCR's hammer server

Usage: ./rshell commands

### Known Bugs
- Many, many memory leaks.
- The separator ; does not work.
- The exit command occasionally does not work after invalid commands are used. The number of times exit must be entered exactly matches the number of invalid commands.
